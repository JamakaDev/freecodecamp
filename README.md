# freecodecamp

-These are the projects that conclude taking the freeCodeCamp.org Scientific Computing Python course.
-I completed the arithmetic_formatter, time_calc, budget_app prior to creating this resp.
-The projects have proven to test you on concepts of programming and not just the syntax("language").
-Please feel free to criticize however.....
-HAVE A GREAT DAY <->
